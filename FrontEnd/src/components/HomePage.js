          Daily workers, often referred to as "daily wage laborers" or "casual
          laborers," play a crucial role in various industries and sectors
          worldwide. These individuals typically work on a temporary or
          contractual basis, performing tasks ranging from construction and
          agriculture to domestic services and manufacturing. Unlike salaried
          employees, daily workers are usually paid based on the number of hours
          they work or the tasks they complete each day. The lives of daily
          workers can be characterized by uncertainty and instability, as they
          often lack job security and may struggle to find consistent
          employment. Many daily workers face economic challenges, including low
          wages and irregular income, which can make it difficult to support
          themselves and their families.
